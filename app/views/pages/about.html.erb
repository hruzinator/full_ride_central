            <p><strong>Why does Full Ride Central exist?</strong></p>
<p>Full Ride Central exists to help students find full-ride and full-tuition merit-based scholarships.  These scholarships can be worth anywhere from $5,000 to $50,000 per year, and are available to high-achieving students at specific colleges and universities.</p>
<p><strong>Aren&#8217;t there other websites that already do that?</strong></p>
<p>Not quite.  There are lots of great scholarship guides out there, like FastWeb and Scholarships.com, but those deal almost entirely in private scholarships from organizations and individuals, not from colleges.  Most of these scholarships are pretty small, though a few even cover full tuition or more.  However, <em>most</em> of the major full ride scholarships are <em>institutional</em> scholarships: they come from the colleges themselves.  Despite being a great way to pay for college, these scholarships are often extremely hard to find, as there is no single complete database of them.  Full Ride Central was created to save students the trouble of having to scour the dark corners of the internet for these scholarships, simply by bringing them all together in one place.</p>
<p><strong>Aren&#8217;t full ride merit scholarships extremely hard to get?  How can I qualify?</strong></p>
<p>Getting a full ride <em>is</em> difficult, but not impossible, at least for a high-achieving student.  Very few students attend college on a full ride or full tuition scholarship, but you may be surprised at how many are available.  Most full rides are competitive, requiring a separate application with perhaps an essay or recommendations, but this is usually the case for private scholarships as well.  However, many are automatic.  For instance, did you know that if you are a National Merit Finalist, some universities will automatically give you a full ride scholarship?  Or did you know that there are &#8220;work colleges&#8221; that will waive your tuition in exchange for 15 hours per week of work during the school year, as long as you are accepted to the college?  These are only a few examples of the many possibilities students have for winning a large-scale scholarship.</p>
<p><strong>How do I find these scholarships?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s simple: just check out the <a href="http://fullridecentral.com/scholarships/" >Search</a> function.  If you find something you like, research it more in depth using the links provided.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any full ride scholarships that <em>aren&#8217;t</em> on Full Ride Central?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, plenty.  While it is our goal to find all institutional, merit-based full ride or full tuition scholarships, this is a huge task.  If you know of a scholarship is not yet in our database, feel free to <a href="http://fullridecentral.com/contact/" >contact us with a tip</a>.  The help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>How did Full Ride Central get started?</strong></p>
<p>Full Ride Central was founded in 2013 by a student and Presidential Scholar at the University of Tulsa.  In high school, knowing he wouldn&#8217;t be able to pay for college (and as a philosophy major, $100,000 in debt was out of the question), this student scoured the dark corners of internet for months searching for full ride scholarships.  He eventually found several, applied to them, and won three of them, ultimately choosing the Presidential Scholarship to the University of Tulsa.  However, the process of finding these scholarships and getting info on them took a lot of needless work, and he missed several scholarship opportunities he could have qualified for.  Desiring that no one should have to repeat his experience, he founded Full Ride Central as the solution.</p>
